        In English grammar, WH questions are essential for asking specific information. When forming WH questions with the be-form, we combine WH words (such as who, what, where, when, why, how) with different forms of the verb be (am, is, are, was, were). These questions are used to inquire about various aspects of subjects, actions, or states.

        The verb "be" is the key here and changes depending on the subject and the tense of the sentence. In present tense, we use am, is, or are, and in past tense, we use was or were.
