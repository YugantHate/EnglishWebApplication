      <p>
        Simple Tenses are the most straightforward forms of tense and are used to express habitual actions, completed actions, or actions expected to happen. 
        The three main types of simple tense are Present Simple, Past Simple, and Future Simple. Each type has a unique role in describing actions within 
        different timeframes.
