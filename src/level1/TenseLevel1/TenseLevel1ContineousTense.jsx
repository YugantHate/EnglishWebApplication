        Continuous, and Future Continuous. These tenses emphasize the duration or progression of an action.

      <p>
        To choose the right continuous tense, think about when the action occurs and whether it's ongoing at a specific time. Use Present Continuous for actions happening 
        now, Past Continuous for actions ongoing at a past time, and Future Continuous for actions that will be ongoing in the future.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#2a9d8f' }}>Key Points to Remember</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Present Continuous is for actions happening right now or temporary situations.</li>
        <li>Past Continuous is for actions ongoing at a past time or background events.</li>
        <li>Future Continuous is for actions that will be ongoing at a specific time in the future.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By mastering Continuous Tenses, you can clearly express when actions are ongoing, providing context and depth to your sentences.
